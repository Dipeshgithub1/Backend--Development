- Quick Response (QR) codes have become an integral tool for transferring information quickly and conveniently.
- This project aims to develop a QR code generation API service using Node.js and Express.js.

  # How QR Codes Work - 
- Quick response codes (QR codes) are two-dimensional barcodes that can store much more information than traditional one-dimensional barcodes.
- The following are the basics of how it works.
- Data encoding: The given data (text, URL, contact information, etc.) will be converted into a sequence of bits (binary digits i.e. 0s and 1s).
 - To create “qrcode” and other QR codes in our API, the library uses an error-correcting method that adds extra bits to ensure that even if some parts were damaged during transmission or scanning, it can be rebuilt from scratch.
- Reading and decoding: A smartphone camera or a reader specifically designed for QR codes is able to recognize unique barcodes. The decoder looks for patterns to find timestamps and grd size.
- It then ejects the data module together with the error correction bit. The error correction algorithm repairs any possible errors that may occur based on the image.

#  Steps to create QR Code Generator Service
- Step 1: Create the folder for the project by using the following command.
 - mkdir qr-code-generator
- cd qr-code-generator
# Step 2: Create the server folder inside it and initialize the Node application:
- mkdir server
- cd server   
- npm init -y
# Step 3: Install the required dependencies:
- npm install express qrcode body-parser cors
